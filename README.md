#### 1. Contributing translation fixes
While logged in to your GitHub.com user account, navigate to the simairport-i18n file you wish to update and click the Edit icon. When finished, saving your changes will submit a pull request that'll notify our team. We'll review pull requests on a weekly basis and if approved will include them on the next SimAirport build!

#### 2. Requesting a new language
Create a new "Issue" on this repository requesting the given language and we'll initialize a new directory that can then be used as a target for merging in translation fixes as described in #1. Alternatively, you can create a new pull request by copying the “en” folder and get started right away. Once the majority of strings are translated, the language will be added to SimAirport!
